Machine Learning Process:
Take raw data and prepare/clean it - convert to numeric
Determine algorithm to use and train it using the data
Examine model and use validation method to evaluate, update/repeat as needed
Use model on new data to make predictions

Scikit has tools for every step along the way:
Interoperates with Pandas, Numpy
standardization/normalization/scaling, string conversions, filling missing data
several validation options depending on the model
fit and predict functions with model
pipelines more advanced
